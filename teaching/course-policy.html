	<h2>Grading and Participation</h2>

	<p>If you are enrolled in my course, you need to ask at least <i>four</i> non-trivial questions during the lectures and the four questions need to be in separate lectures. It is up to you to decide whether the question merits <i>non-trivial</i> status. In the final, you will be asked to self-report if you completed this participation requirement.</p>

	<p>Participation is a 1/0 multiplier in terms of your grade. Meaning that if you report that you did not ask at least four questions, the course grade is an automatic 0.0 but I commend you for your honesty. Otherwise, your grade is defined by 60% homework, 20% midterm, and 20% final. </p>

	<h2>Late Policies on Homework</h2>

	<p>When I was an undergraduate, most of my math courses had a deadline of Friday for homework. At that time, problem sets were printed or hand-written and dropped off in a mailbox in the math department. But it was well known that the grading graduate student didn't check the mailbox until they returned to campus on Monday morning.</p>

	<p>In that spirit, homeworks in this course will be due on Gradescope on Fridays at 5 PM. But homework will only be considered late if it is not turned in by the time our graders start grading on Monday. Anything past that timestamp will be graded with a 50% demerit if it is turned in before the final begins.</p>

	<p>To be extra clear: when our graders start grading is a random variable and not in your control. I will not tolerate any complaining on this matter. If you want to guarantee your homework is graded accurately, you should turn it in on Friday. 
	</p>

	<p>Any extenuating circumstance should be discussed with the instructor by Thursday.</p>
