	<h2>Grading and Participation</h2>

	<p>If you are enrolled in my course, you need to ask at least <i>four</i> non-trivial questions during the lectures and the four questions need to be in separate lectures. It is up to you to decide whether a question merits <i>non-trivial</i> status. In the final, you will be asked to self-report if you completed this participation requirement.</p>

	<p>Participation is a 1/0 multiplier in terms of your grade. Meaning that if you report that you did not ask at least four questions, the course grade is an automatic 0.0 but I commend you for your honesty. Otherwise, your grade is defined by 60% homework, 20% midterm, and 20% final. </p>

	<h2>Late Policies on Homework</h2>

	<p>Homeworks in this course will be due on Gradescope on Fridays at 5 PM. But as this is a graduate course, homework will only be considered late if it is not turned in by the time our graders want to grade it. Our graders will not start grading till Monday. Anything past that timestamp will be graded with a 50% demerit if it is turned in before the final exam begins. Neither the instructor nor the staff will be available for help past Friday at 5pm.</p>

	<p>To be extra clear: when our graders start grading is a random variable and not in your control. If you want to guarantee your homework is graded for complete marks, you should turn it in on Friday. 
	</p>

	<p>Any extenuating circumstance should be discussed with the instructor by Thursday.</p>
