	<h2>Grading and Participation</h2>

	<p>If you are enrolled in my course, there is a mandatory participation requirement of asking at least <i>four</i> non-trivial questions during the course. You can ask these questions to me during class or during office hours. It is up to you to decide whether a question merits <i>non-trivial</i> status.

	<p>Assuming you complete the participation requirement, your grade is defined by 60% homework, 20% midterm, and 20% final. </p>

	<h2>Late Policies on Homework</h2>

	<p>Homeworks in this course will be due on Gradescope on Fridays at 5 PM. But as this is a graduate course, homework will only be considered late if it is not turned in by the time our graders want to grade it. Our graders will not start grading till Monday. Anything past that timestamp will be graded with a 50% demerit if it is turned in before the final exam begins. Neither the instructor nor the staff will be available for help past Friday at 5 PM.</p>

	<p>To be extra clear: when our graders start grading is a random variable and not in your control. If you want to guarantee your homework is graded for complete marks, you should turn it in on Friday. 
	</p>

	<p>Any extenuating circumstance should be discussed with the instructor by Thursday.</p>
