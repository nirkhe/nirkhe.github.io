	<h2>Course Description</h2>
	Graduate level course on the the theory of quantum computing and quantum information. Course begins with mathematical formalism of quantum information and computation, and covers quantum circuits, entanglement, algorithms, error-correction and complexity theory. Potential additional topics include Hamiltonian complexity, cryptography, error mitigation, and near-term quantum computation.

	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>The course material will be accessible to both computer scientists and physicists, provided they have a strong mathematical background. No explicit prerequisites are set for this course. We will review what is necessary but students with weaker math backgrounds may need to review material outside the course as necessary.</p>

	<p> My expectation is that students should have taken and done well in courses on the theory of computation (such as CSE 431, 531, or equiv.) and theory of algorithms (such as CSE 417, CSE 521-22, 525, or equiv.) as we will be extending the results from classical computation to quantum computation. A strong mathematical background in linear algebra is also necessary (such as MATH 318, 340, or equiv.). It also helps to have taken group theory (such as MATH 402-04, 411-12, or equiv.), and analysis (such as MATH 327, 424-28 or equiv.). No physics knowledge is necessary but it is certainly helpful to have taken a previous course on quantum mechanics (such as PHYS 225, 324, or equiv.).</p>

	<p>Undergraduate students unsure of whether they have the appropriate background should discuss with me as soon as possible.</p>

	<h2>Literature</h2>

	There are no explicit textbooks for this course but the following is a pretty good library to have around. I will link related readings from these books or online lecture notes as appropriate:

		<li>Kitaev, Shen, and Vyalyi. <i>Classical and Quantum Computation.</i></li>
		<li>Wong. <i>Introduction to Classical and Quantum Computing.</i></li>
	</ul>

	The following are topics textbooks that might be helpful.
